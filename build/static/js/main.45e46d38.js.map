className=\"info-content\">\n                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The history of silk began 4700 years ago in China. The evidence shows that China spreaded the culture of silk weaving \n                        process to nearby countries, including Thailand. However, the archeologists found the remnant of silk cloth in Ban Chiang, \n                        <div className=\"pic_zone\"><img className=\"info-pic\" src={require('../img/Information/Thai-silk.jpg')} alt=\"his-pic\"/></div>\n                        Chiang Mai province. The oldest remnant of cloth is from 3000 years old approximately. At the King Rama V reign, \n                        his majesty supported silk farming (sericulture) and Thai weaving. But at that time the technology knowledge \n                        was not ready for silk farming, Thai people could only create rough silk materials. Not too long after that,\n                        the King created the silk department, \n                        which later called the Queen Sirikit Department of Sericulture, to support silk farming. \n                        The King also hired the Japanese expert to help improving silk farming processes in Thailand. Nevertheless, after the King \n                        passed away the silk farming became unpopular. Until 2479 BE, the government started to promote silk farming again along with\n                        the year 2491 BE,  Jim Thompson founded the company selling Thai silk products and materials. \n                        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nowaday, silk weaving and silk market have grown and develop to be more industrial in order to \n                        export goods to foreign countries, including Thailand.\n                        <div className=\"info-ref\"> \n                            References: “ประวัติ และความเป็นมาของผ้าไหมไทย.” ประวัติ และความเป็นมาของผ้าไหมไทย ~, thaiphamai.blogspot.com/2013/04/blog-post.html.\n                        </div>\n                    </div>         \n                </div>\n            </div>\n        )\n    }\n}\n\nexport default SilkHis\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/SilkHis.js","import React , {Component} from 'react'\nimport '../CSS/Info.css'\n\nclass TypeInfo extends Component {\n\n    render(){\n        return (\n            <div className=\"col-md-9 push-md-3\">\n                 <div className=\"info-header\">\n                    Silk Information \n                </div>\n                <div className=\"info-border\">\n                    <div className=\"info-topic\">\n                        The Different Types \n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"info-content\">\n                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The first is mulberry silk. Mulberry silk is the main type of commercial silk\n                        available in the market today. It gets its name from a silkworm that lives and feeds\n                        exclusively on the leaves of the mulberry plant. This type of silk is the strongest\n                        natural fiber known to man and can last for many years.\n                        \n                        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The second is Tasar silk. Tasar silk is easy to recognize because of its\n                        copperish color. It is this color that makes it ideal for interior decor and furnishing.\n                        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The third is Eri Silk. Its texture can be coarse or fine, and it is mainly cream\n                        in color, although it’s not as shiny as many other types. It is also strong and quite\n                        elastic. Furthermore, it is heavier than most other types.\n                        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The fourth is Muga Silk. The quantity of muga silk produced is quite small,\n                        which means that most of it is used within the areas where it is produced, such as\n                        Assam in India, where it is used to make traditional dresses.\n                        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The fifth is Anaphe Silk. In Africa, anaphe silk is the most common type. It is\n                        usually soft and quite lustrous. In southern and central Africa, a number of\n                        communities use anaphe silk to make velvet due to its strength and elasticity.\n                        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The last is spider silk. Spider silk is resistant to extreme temperature and humidity.\n                        <br/><br/>\n                        <img className=\"pic-info2\" src={require('../img/Information/type.jpg') } alt=\"type-pic\" width=\"25%\" height=\"250px\" />  \n                        <img className=\"pic-info2\"  src={require('../img/Information/type1.jpg')} alt=\"type-pic\" width=\"25%\" height=\"250px\"/>  \n                        <img className=\"pic-info2\"  src={require('../img/Information/type2.jpg')} alt=\"type-pic\" width=\"25%\" height=\"250px\"/>   \n                        <img className=\"pic-info2\"  src={require('../img/Information/type3.jpg')} alt=\"type-pic\" width=\"25%\" height=\"250px\"/>   \n                        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In addition, Types of Thai silk to be able to identify genuine Thai mulberry\n                        silk easily, Thailand’s Agriculture Ministry uses a peacock emblem to authenticate\n                        Thai silk and protect it from imitations.
