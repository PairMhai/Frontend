                    The Different Types of Silk

                <div className="info-content">
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The first is mulberry silk. Mulberry silk is the main type of commercial silk
                    available in the market today. It gets its name from a silkworm that lives and feeds
                    exclusively on the leaves of the mulberry plant. This type of silk is the strongest
                    natural fiber known to man and can last for many years.
                    <br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The second is Tasar silk. Tasar silk is easy to recognize because of its
                    copperish color. It is this color that makes it ideal for interior decor and furnishing.
                    <br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The third is Eri Silk. Its texture can be coarse or fine, and it is mainly cream
                    in color, although it’s not as shiny as many other types. It is also strong and quite
                    elastic. Furthermore, it is heavier than most other types.
                    <br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The fourth is Muga Silk. The quantity of muga silk produced is quite small,
                    which means that most of it is used within the areas where it is produced, such as
                    Assam in India, where it is used to make traditional dresses.
                    <br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The fifth is Anaphe Silk. In Africa, anaphe silk is the most common type. It is
                    usually soft and quite lustrous. In southern and central Africa, a number of
                    communities use anaphe silk to make velvet due to its strength and elasticity.
                    <br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The last is spider silk. Spider silk is resistant to extreme temperature and humidity.
                    <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In addition, Types of Thai silk to be able to identify genuine Thai mulberry
                    silk easily, Thailand’s Agriculture Ministry uses a peacock emblem to authenticate
